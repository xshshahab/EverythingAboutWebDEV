    <h2>Understanding of HTML Boilerplate code.</h2>
    <p>
        The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is the very first thing in an HTML document. It is used to define the document type and specifies that the page is written in HTML5. It tells the browser that the page should be rendered using the HTML5 standard, which ensures that the page is displayed correctly. This declaration is not an HTML tag, but it is essential for modern web browsers to interpret the document properly.

    <p>
        The `<html lang="en">` tag starts the HTML document and represents the root of the HTML structure. The `lang="en"` attribute specifies that the content of the page is written in English. This attribute helps search engines, screen readers, and other technologies determine the language of the document. It's a good practice to always include this attribute for accessibility and SEO purposes.

        Inside the `<html>` tag, there is a `<head>` section. The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the page, which is not visible to the user but is crucial for browsers and search engines. The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is the most widely used character encoding because it can represent almost every character in every language, ensuring that your content is displayed correctly on any device.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another important meta tag is the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag. This tag ensures that the webpage is responsive, meaning it will adjust its layout and content to fit various screen sizes, especially for mobile devices. `width=device-width` tells the browser to use the deviceâ€™s screen width as the viewport width, while `initial-scale=1.0` ensures that the page is initially displayed at its normal zoom level without scaling.
    </p>

    <p>
        The `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's tab or window. This is important for both the user experience and search engine optimization (SEO). The title should be descriptive and concise, as it provides users with information about the content of the page. In this case, the title is "Learning Day01", but it can be customized to reflect the purpose of the page.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the `<head>` section, the `<body>` tag begins. The body section contains the content that users see on the webpage. This is where all your visible elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links are placed. The first element in the body is typically a heading, represented by the `<h1>` tag. In this case, `<h1>Day 01</h1>` is the main heading for the page. The `<h1>` tag is important because it signifies the most important heading on the page and is typically used for titles or main topics.
    </p>

    <p>
        The `<h2>` tag following the `<h1>` tag represents a subheading. In this case, it is used to provide more context or a secondary title for the page. The `<h2>` tag is commonly used to structure content into sections and subsections. It helps organize the page's structure, making it easier for users to read and for search engines to understand.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, the `<p>` tag represents a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are used to group related sentences together. In the boilerplate code, this `<p></p>` tag is empty, but it is typically used to display descriptive content, explanations, or information that the user will read. This is the part where you would add most of the content that makes up the body of your webpage.
