# Conditional Rendering & Rendering Lists in React

## Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like `if`, `&&`, `||`, and the ternary operator to dynamically render components.

## Rendering Lists

To render a list in React, use JavaScript's `map()` method to iterate over an array and return JSX for each item. Always provide a unique key prop for list elements.
