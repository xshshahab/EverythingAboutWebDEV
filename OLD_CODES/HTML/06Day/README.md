# SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML

SEO and Core Web Vitals are two important concepts in the world of web development. SEO stands for
Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website in
search engine results pages (SERPs) through various techniques. Core Web Vitals, on the other
hand, are a set of metrics that measure the user experience of a website, specifically focusing on the
loading, interactivity, and visual stability of a page.
In this chapter, we will explore how to improve SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML.

### Improving SEO in HTML

Improving SEO in HTML involves optimizing the structure and content of your HTML document to make
it more search engine friendly. Here are some tips to improve SEO in HTML:

- **Use descriptive and concise titles**: Use the `<title>` element to provide a concise and
  descriptive title for your page. This title should accurately reflect the content of your page.
- **Use header elements**: Use header elements such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. to structure
  your content and improve readability for both users and search engines.
- **Use descriptive and concise meta descriptions**: Use the `<meta name="description">`
  element to provide a brief summary of your page's content. This description is often displayed
  in search engine results, so it's crucial to write it compellingly to encourage clicks.
- **Use alt text for images**: Use the `alt` attribute to provide a description of each image on
  your page. This is important for accessibility (helping screen readers describe images to
  users) and can also help search engines understand the content of your images.
- **Use descriptive and concise URLs**: Use descriptive and concise URLs that accurately
  reflect the content of the page. Avoid using long, cryptic URLs that are difficult to read
  and remember.
- **Use internal linking**: Use internal linking to help search engines understand the
  structure and hierarchy of your website. Link to relevant pages within your site to
  guide users and improve search engine crawlability.
- **Use descriptive and concise anchor text**: Use descriptive and concise anchor text
  for your internal and external links. Avoid generic anchor text like "click here"
  and instead use keywords that accurately describe the linked page.
- **Use descriptive and concise meta keywords**: Use the `<meta name="keywords">`
  element to specify the main keywords related to your page's content. Note that
  the importance of meta keywords for SEO has diminished in recent years, but
  they can still be helpful for some search engines.
- **Use descriptive and concise meta robots**: Use the `<meta name="robots">`
  element to provide instructions to search engine crawlers about how to index
  and follow links on your page. For example, you can use the `noindex`
  directive to prevent a page from being indexed in search results.

**Note:** This is a basic overview. SEO is a complex and ongoing process that requires continuous
effort and analysis.
