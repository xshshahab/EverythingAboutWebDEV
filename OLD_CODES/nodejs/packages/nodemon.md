# What is Nodemon?

Nodemon is a tool that automatically restarts your Node.js application when you make changes to the source code. It saves you from manually restarting the app each time you update your code.

## How to Use It:

1. First, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
2. When you run `npm i nodemon`, npm will download and install Nodemon as a package in your project.
3. After installation, you can use Nodemon instead of `node` to run your application. It will `automatically watch` for any changes in your code and restart the application for you.

## Installing Nodemon

To install Nodemon in your Node.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npm i nodemon
```
