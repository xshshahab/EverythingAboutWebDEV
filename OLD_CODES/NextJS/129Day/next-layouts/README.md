# Layouts in Next.js

In Next.js, layouts are used to define a consistent structure across different pages in your application. They allow you to centralize and reuse common components like headers, footers, and sidebars, improving maintainability and scalability.

## Key Concepts

- **Reusable Layout Components**: Define a layout component with common elements that are shared across multiple pages.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: Choose different layouts for different pages based on the needs of the page.
- **Nested Layouts**: Create layouts within layouts for more complex page structures.
