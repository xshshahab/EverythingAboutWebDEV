# Script, Link & Image components in Next.js

In Next.js, the `Script`, `Link`, and `Image` components are designed to enhance performance and developer experience. Here's an overview of each:

### 1. **Script Component**

The `Script` component is used to manage external scripts in a performant way. Next.js helps optimize the loading of scripts by allowing you to specify loading behavior.

### 2. **`Link` Component**

The `Link` component is used for client-side navigation between pages in a Next.js application. It prefetches pages in the background, making navigation instant.

### **3. `Image` Component**

The `Image` component optimizes image loading and delivery, improving performance by:

- Supporting automatic **image optimization** (e.g., resizing, compression).
- Using modern formats like **WebP** when supported.
- Handling lazy-loading and responsive sizes automatically.
