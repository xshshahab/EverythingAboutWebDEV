# JavaScript For Loop

The `for` loop in JavaScript is one of the most commonly used loops to repeat a block of code multiple times. It allows you to execute a set of statements based on a given condition.

This project demonstrates the usage of the `for` loop in JavaScript with examples.

## Syntax of the `for` Loop

The syntax for a basic `for` loop is:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment / decrement) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```

# JavaScript While Loop

The `while` loop in JavaScript is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. It's useful when you want to repeat a set of statements an unknown number of times but want to continue based on the condition.

This project demonstrates the usage of the `while` loop in JavaScript with examples.

## Syntax of the `while` Loop

The syntax for a basic `while` loop is:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```

# JavaScript Do...While Loop

The `do...while` loop in JavaScript is similar to the `while` loop but with one important difference: the code inside the loop is executed **at least once**, even if the condition is `false`. The condition is evaluated **after** each iteration.

This project demonstrates the usage of the `do...while` loop in JavaScript with examples.

---

## Syntax of the `do...while` Loop

The syntax for the `do...while` loop is:

```javascript
do {
  // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

# JavaScript For...In Loop

The `for...in` loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over the **enumerable properties** of an object or array. It is particularly useful for looping through the properties of an object.

This project demonstrates the usage of the `for...in` loop in JavaScript with examples.

---

## Syntax of the `for...in` Loop

The syntax for the `for...in` loop is:

```javascript
for (let key in object) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```

# JavaScript For...Of Loop

The `for...of` loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over the **iterable objects** like arrays, strings, and other iterable collections. Unlike the `for...in` loop, the `for...of` loop gives you the **values** of the iterable rather than the property names or indices.

This project demonstrates the usage of the `for...of` loop in JavaScript with examples.

---

## Syntax of the `for...of` Loop

The syntax for the `for...of` loop is:

```javascript
for (let item of iterable) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```
