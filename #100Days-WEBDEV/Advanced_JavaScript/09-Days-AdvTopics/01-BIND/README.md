Let's break down the code and understand each part, especially focusing on how `.bind()` works.

---

## üîπ Step-by-step Explanation:

```js
let obj = {
  username: "xshshahab",
  profileName: "Mohammad Shahabuddin",
  github_url: "https://github.com/xshshahab",
};
```

This is a simple **JavaScript object** named `obj`. It holds three properties:

- `username`
- `profileName`
- `github_url`

---

### Function Definition:

```js
function getAllDetails(para1, para2) {
  console.log(this, para1, para2);
}
```

This function logs:

1. `this` ‚Äì which refers to the context the function is called with.
2. `para1` ‚Äì the first argument.
3. `para2` ‚Äì the second argument.

---

### Using `.bind()`:

```js
let fnc = getAllDetails.bind(
  obj,
  {
    name: "Suman",
    age: 27,
  },
  {
    name: "Sapna",
    age: 21,
  }
);
```

Here‚Äôs what happens:

1. `getAllDetails.bind(...)` creates a **new function** with:

   - A fixed `this` value (`obj`)
   - The first two arguments **predefined** (`para1`, `para2`)

So `fnc` becomes a new function that:

- Always runs `getAllDetails` with:

  - `this = obj`
  - `para1 = { name: "Suman", age: 27 }`
  - `para2 = { name: "Sapna", age: 21 }`

Note: It doesn‚Äôt call the function yet ‚Äî it just **returns a new version of it**.

---

### Finally calling the bound function:

```js
fnc();
```

Now when we call `fnc()`, it runs like this:

```js
getAllDetails.call(obj, { name: "Suman", age: 27 }, { name: "Sapna", age: 21 });
```

So the output of this line:

```js
console.log(this, para1, para2);
```

Will be:

```
{
  username: "xshshahab",
  profileName: "Mohammad Shahabuddin",
  github_url: "https://github.com/xshshahab"
}
{ name: "Suman", age: 27 }
{ name: "Sapna", age: 21 }
```

## üîπ What is `.bind()` in JavaScript?

`.bind()` is a method available on **functions** in JavaScript. It is used to **create a new function** where:

- You fix the value of `this`
- Optionally, you can **pre-fill** some arguments (this is called **partial application**)

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

```js
let newFunc = originalFunc.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)
```

- `thisArg` ‚Üí What you want `this` to refer to
- `arg1, arg2, ...` ‚Üí Optional arguments to pass in advance

---

## üîπ Example to understand `.bind()` simply:

```js
let person = {
  name: "Ali",
};

function sayHello(greeting) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, my name is ${this.name}`);
}

let boundHello = sayHello.bind(person, "Hello");

boundHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Ali"
```

Without `.bind()`, `this.name` would be `undefined`, but with `.bind(person)`, it uses `person` as `this`.

## üîÅ Summary:

| Concept          | In this code                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `this`           | Bound to `obj` using `.bind()`                    |
| `para1`, `para2` | Pre-set with objects for Suman & Sapna            |
| `bind()`         | Creates a new function with fixed `this` and args |
| `fnc()`          | Executes the function with those fixed values     |

Let me know if you want to see this example visually or explore `.call()` and `.apply()` next.
