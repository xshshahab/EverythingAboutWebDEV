Great question. Let's analyze both approaches from a **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** perspective—focusing on **time complexity, space complexity, and general algorithmic suitability**.

### 🔍 **1st Approach: Using `pop()` and `push()`**

```js
let fruitArray = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana"];
fruitArray.pop(); // O(1)
fruitArray.push("Kiwi"); // O(1)
```

#### ✅ DSA Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(1)` — Constant time operations since `pop()` and `push()` work at the end of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — No extra space used.

#### ✅ Use Case:

Efficient **if and only if** the item to be replaced is at the **end** of the array.

#### ❌ Limitation:

Not usable for arbitrary positions — **not general-purpose**.

---

### 🔍 **2nd Approach: Iterative Replacement**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < fruitArray2.length; i++) {
  if (fruitArray2[i] === "Banana") {
    fruitArray2[i] = "Kiwi";
  }
}
```

#### ✅ DSA Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — You iterate through all elements to find the target.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — Replacement done in-place.

#### ✅ Use Case:

This is the **standard algorithmic approach** when you're not sure where the item is or if there are multiple instances to replace.

#### ✅ Pros:

- **Works for any position**.
- **Scalable** to multiple replacements.

### 🆚 DSA Summary:

| Metric              | 1st Approach (`pop`/`push`) | 2nd Approach (loop) |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Time Complexity     | O(1)                        | O(n)                |
| Space Complexity    | O(1)                        | O(1)                |
| Flexibility         | ❌ Only end position        | ✅ Any position     |
| General-purpose use | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes              |

### 🏁 **Conclusion (From a DSA Lens):**

- **Use the 1st approach** **only if you have a controlled case** (e.g., modifying a known-last element).
- **Use the 2nd approach** for a **DSA-friendly, scalable solution** — especially in interviews, production code, or problems involving search/replace in arrays.

If you’re preparing for DSA interviews or writing robust code, **2nd approach is clearly better**.
